                    This report is a summary of my first work term project in Nanjing Hydraulic Research Institute River and Harbour Engineering Department, 
                including the reason of developing this system, system design procedure, hardware and software introduction of the system.
                I participated in developing a system to measure water level on flood plain, 
                for the purpose of exploring the possibility of flood plain resources utilization.  
                My major task in this project is developing an edge detection program for extracting water surface boundary on flood plain.
                I was engaged in system design, ima
